# TODO

Tracked future work for RustDude.

## Constraint system

Add a generalized constraint system (joints, orientation locks, distance constraints) to the physics solver. Immediate need: keep the player capsule upright.

Design doc: [CONSTRAINT_SYSTEM_PLAN.md](CONSTRAINT_SYSTEM_PLAN.md)

### Deferred work

Items explicitly deferred from the initial implementation. These should be addressed before the corresponding features ship.

- **Constraint islands for sleeping** — constraints must participate in island building so that a sleeping body constrained to an awake body gets woken. Safe to skip only while all constraints are world-anchored on always-awake bodies (keep-upright on player). **Must be wired in before any two-body constraint (distance, hinge) ships.**
- **Constraint-aware shock propagation** — the conditioner may need to see constraint edges to compute correct BFS depths when a constraint bridges two contact sub-graphs. Not needed for world-anchored constraints.
- **Per-substep row re-expansion** — initial implementation expands rows once per frame. If multi-substep drift causes visible artifacts with positional constraints (distance, hinge), re-expansion can be added to `substep()`.
- **Hinge, ball-joint, prismatic, motor variants** — add as needed, the row-based infrastructure supports them.
- **Constraint breaking** — max force thresholds for breakable joints.
- **Constraint debug visualization** — rendering constraint axes, limits, error vectors in the debug overlay.
